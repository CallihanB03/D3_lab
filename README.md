## Abstract
The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to compute an analytical representation of key cosmological equations regarding supernovas. 

## Fourier Series Decomposition using Lasso Regression
Since this project deals with sparsely sampled signals, the data was decomposed using a fourier series decompositon. This was done using....



## VAE For Learning A Lower Dimensional Representation Of The Data
Variational Autoencoders are used to learn a lower dimensional represenation of the data.
